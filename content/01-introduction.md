<h1>1. We Analyse & Suggest.</h1>


<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
<p>A leasing is not a coincidence. It is the logical result of a unique leasing process engineered by a buildingClinique™, where we ANALYSE and audit the commercial attractiveness of your property. And we also SUGGEST all necessary improvements  that will maximise leasing opportunities.<br /></p>


<p>The commercial attractiveness of your property is benchmarked against 167 commercial parameters, relying on 16 years property experience*.<br /></p>


<small>* In 16 years we’ve never left an empty building behind.</small>

<p>Secondly, our lettingTools™ create true “WILLINGNESS-TO-RENT”.<br /></p>
