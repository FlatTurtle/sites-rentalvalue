 	   <p>Location, Location, Location : "when companies move office, they look for the best Accessible option".<br /> 
 	   Yet, during the 15 minutes prospective tenants are viewing each property, drawing up a shortlist, 
 	   little to no sophisticated info is provided to visualise the “accessibility” of the property they're standing in.<br /></p>
 	   <p>With a realtime FlatTurtle display, potential occupiers see, experience and understand the overall 
 	   accessibility of your property; allowing them to make a more informed decision about leasing your space faster.<br /></p> 
 	    
 	   This makes makes your property perform and stand out from the lot.</p>
