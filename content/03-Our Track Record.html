<h1>Our Track Record</h1>
<h2>is impressive</h2>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
<p>By applying rentalValue’s 3-stage approach, buildings that have been empty for several years have obtained their 1st lease in less than 90 days, without exception :</p>

<p>Résonance, Paris</br></p>
<p>LeopoldThree, Brussels</br></p>
<p>Atlantis, Brussels</p>
<p>AmadeusSquare, Brussels</p>
<p>mHouse, Antwerp</br></p>
<p>sneeuwBes, Antwerp</br></p>
<p>Zwarte Doos, Groningen</p>
<p>Vida, Amsterdam</br></p>

<p>With rentalValue’s approach, our buildings, and our agents – telling the best stories and providing such a unique visiting “experience” – win tenants faster because they "want" the building.</br></p>
<p>Providing a different perspective, specialised real estate expertise and a driven focus on a particular building, rentalValue has achieved a strong track record for getting office properties leased in record  time.</br></p>
<p>rentalValue creates a building experience that surprises brokers, that gets people talking and truly engages prospective tenants.</br></p>
<p>rentalValue’s properties attract more viewings since they increase the likelihood of a good visit, making my job as a broker easier.</br></p>
