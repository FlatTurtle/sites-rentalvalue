 	   <p>Our applications - lettingTools™ - attract more visits by brokers since they increase the likelihood of a good visit and of a deal.<br /></p>
 	    
 	   <p>Location, Location, Location : when companies move office, they look for the best Accessible option.<br /> 
 	   Yet, during the 15 minutes a company is visiting each property, drawing up a shortlist, 
 	   little to no info is provided to visualise the “accessibility” of the property they're standing in.<br /></p>
 	   <p>With a realtime display, potential occupiers  see, experience and understand the overall accessibility of your property; allowing them to make a more informed decision about leasing your space faster. 
 	    
 	   This makes makes your property perform and stand out from the lot.
